# cnbs-predictor

## Overview
Welcome to cnbs-predictor! This project is an advanced software product built to forecast the components of net basin supply (NBS) for the Laurentian Great Lakes using NOAA forecast data. It builds upon and expands the capabilities of our initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP), [NBS-Predictor-MVP](https://github.com/great-lakes-ai-lab/NBS-Predictor-MVP).

## Planned Features
- Advanced predictive algorithms (e.g. Gaussian processes)
- User-friendly enhancements 
- Real-time data processing
- Continuous iteration and improvement
- More sophisticated data handling and modeling

## Target
Forecast precipitation, evaporation, and runoff, which are the components net basin supply (NBS), for all Laurentian Great Lakes six months into the future at quarter-monthly intervals. 

## Inputs
Utilizes NOAA forecast data from the Climate Forecast System (CFS).
