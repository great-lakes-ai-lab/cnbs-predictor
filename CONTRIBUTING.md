### Branch Naming Conventions

When creating branches for your work, please follow these conventions to keep the project organized:

1. **Feature Branches**: Use `feature/` followed by your initials, the issue number, and a short description of the feature (e.g., `feature/dj_123_add-forecasting-model`).

2. **Bugfix Branches**: Use `bugfix/` followed by your initials, the issue number, and a short description of the bug being fixed (e.g., `bugfix/dj_456_fix-forecast-bug`).

3. **Hotfix Branches**: Use `hotfix/` followed by your initials, the issue number, and a description of the critical fix (e.g., `hotfix/dj_789_urgent-forecast-bug`).

4. **Documentation Branches**: Use `docs/` followed by your initials, the issue number, and a short description (e.g., `docs/dj_101_update-readme`).

5. **Other Branch Types**: Use a prefix that clearly indicates the type of work being done (e.g., `test/` for test additions, `chore/` for maintenance).

#### Example Branch Names:
- `feature/dj_123_optimize-predictions`
- `bugfix/dj_456_fix-csv-import`
- `hotfix/dj_789_urgent-forecast-bug`
- `docs/dj_101_update-readme`
- `test/dj_102_add-unit-tests`

Following this naming convention will make it easier to identify the purpose of each branch and maintain a clean, organized repository.

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- When possible, reference issues and pull requests after the first line.

### Documentation Styleguide

- Use **Markdown** for documentation.
- Reference variables in `backticks` for clarity (e.g., `variable_name`).
